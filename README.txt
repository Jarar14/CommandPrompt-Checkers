# Checkers-ConsoleRun

This is a fully-functional 2-player checkers game that runs completely on Command Prompt (console). It uses traditional American Checkers rules.

It's simple, clean, and entirely foolproof. Just run the program, enter which move you want to make, the piece you want to move, and move on to the next player!
